          <h3>My Journey to Product Management</h3>
          <p>
            I began my career in analytics and consulting, where I learned how to dissect problems, derive insights from data, and collaborate with cross-functional teams. Over time, I became increasingly drawn to roles that allowed me to shape user experiences, define product strategy, and drive business outcomes â€” which led me to product management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I use my background in data and business to inform product decisions that create value for users. I created PM Pathfinder to help others, like me, who are navigating the complex but rewarding journey into product management.
